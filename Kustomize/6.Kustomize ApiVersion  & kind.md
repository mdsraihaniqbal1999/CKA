# Kustomize: Understanding `apiVersion` and `kind`

## üìå What are `apiVersion` and `kind` in Kubernetes & Kustomize?
In Kubernetes, every resource definition requires **`apiVersion`** and **`kind`** to define how the resource is processed. Kustomize also has its own `apiVersion` and `kind` to define how configurations should be managed.

---

## üîπ What is `apiVersion`?
- Defines the **API group and version** of a Kubernetes resource.
- Ensures compatibility with the Kubernetes API server.
- The `apiVersion` changes over time as Kubernetes evolves.

### **Common API Versions**
| `apiVersion` | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `v1` | Core API group (Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets). |
| `apps/v1` | Manages Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets. |
| `batch/v1` | Used for CronJobs and Jobs. |
| `policy/v1` | Defines policies like PodSecurityPolicy and PodDisruptionBudget. |
| `rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1` | Manages role-based access control (RBAC). |

---

## üîπ What is `kind`?
- Specifies the **type of resource** being created.
- Determines how Kubernetes interprets the manifest.

### **Common Kubernetes Resource Kinds**
| `kind` | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `Pod` | Smallest deployable unit, runs a container. |
| `Deployment` | Manages stateless applications. |
| `StatefulSet` | Manages stateful applications (e.g., databases). |
| `Service` | Exposes a set of pods as a network service. |
| `ConfigMap` | Stores non-sensitive configuration data. |
| `Secret` | Stores sensitive data securely. |
| `Ingress` | Manages external HTTP/S access. |

---

## üìñ `apiVersion` and `kind` in Kustomize
Kustomize has its own API version and kind to define how customizations should be applied.

### **Example `kustomization.yaml`**
```yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization

resources:
  - deployment.yaml
  - service.yaml
```
**Explanation:**
- `apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` ‚Üí Specifies that this is a Kustomize configuration.
- `kind: Kustomization` ‚Üí Declares that this file manages Kustomize overlays.
- `resources:` ‚Üí Lists the Kubernetes manifests being customized.

### **Common API Versions for Kustomize**
| `apiVersion` | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1` | Standard Kustomize version used in Kubernetes 1.14+. |
| `kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1` | Older version of Kustomize API. |

## üî• Checking Supported API Versions
To check available `apiVersion` values for resources in your cluster, run:
```sh
kubectl api-resources
```
Example output:
```sh
NAME              SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                       KIND
pods             po           v1                               Pod
deployments      deploy       apps/v1                          Deployment
services        svc           v1                               Service
```

To check the API versions your cluster supports:
```sh
kubectl api-versions
```

---

## üèÜ Best Practices for `apiVersion` and `kind`
- **Use the latest stable API version** to ensure compatibility with Kubernetes updates.
- **Verify supported API versions** using `kubectl api-versions`.
- **Use the correct `kind`** that fits your resource needs (e.g., `Deployment` for apps, `StatefulSet` for databases).
- **Ensure compatibility** by checking Kubernetes release notes before upgrading API versions.
- **Use `kubectl explain`** to get details on any resource:
  ```sh
  kubectl explain deployment
  ```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- **`apiVersion`** defines the Kubernetes API version a resource belongs to.
- **`kind`** specifies what type of Kubernetes resource is being created.
- **Kustomize uses `apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1`** and `kind: Kustomization`.
- **Check available API versions** using `kubectl api-resources` and `kubectl api-versions`.
- **Follow best practices** to keep configurations up to date.
