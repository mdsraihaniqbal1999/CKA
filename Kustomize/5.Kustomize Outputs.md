# Kustomize Output and Delete

## 📌 Understanding Kustomize Output
`kustomize build` is a powerful command that **generates the final YAML** configuration by applying all transformations, overlays, and patches without deploying them. This helps in **reviewing changes before applying them**.

---

## 🔍 How to Use `kustomize build`
Before applying any Kustomize configuration, use `kustomize build` to preview the final output.

### **Example Command:**
```sh
kustomize build k8s/overlays/dev/
```

### **Expected Output:**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Explanation:**
- `kustomize build` **does not apply changes**; it **only prints** the final YAML.
- It helps **debug** configurations before deployment.
- It combines **base manifests** with **overlays** to show the final state.

---

## 🚀 Applying Kustomize Output
Once the output is verified, apply the configuration using:
```sh
kustomize build k8s/overlays/dev/ | kubectl apply -f -
```
OR use `kubectl kustomize` directly:
```sh
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev/
```

---

## 🗑️ Deleting Resources Using Kustomize
To **remove resources** managed by Kustomize, use **kubectl delete** with `-k` or `kustomize build` piped into `kubectl delete`.

### **Delete Using `kubectl delete -k` (Recommended)**
```sh
kubectl delete -k k8s/overlays/dev/
```

### **Delete Using `kustomize build` + `kubectl delete`**
```sh
kustomize build k8s/overlays/dev/ | kubectl delete -f -
```

### **Expected Output:**
```sh
deployment.apps "nginx-deployment" deleted
service "nginx-service" deleted
```

## 🔥 When to Use `kustomize build` vs `kubectl apply -k`?
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `kustomize build <path>` | Prints the final YAML for review (no deployment). |
| `kubectl apply -k <path>` | Applies the Kustomize configuration to the cluster. |
| `kubectl delete -k <path>` | Deletes all resources managed by Kustomize in the specified path. |

---

## ✅ Summary
- **`kustomize build`** previews the final YAML before applying it.
- **Use `kubectl apply -k`** to deploy resources.
- **Use `kubectl delete -k`** to remove all resources defined in Kustomize.
- **`kustomize build` + `kubectl delete -f -`** is another method to remove resources.
