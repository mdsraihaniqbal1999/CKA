# Kustomization.yaml: The Core of Kustomize

## 📌 What is `kustomization.yaml`?
`kustomization.yaml` is the core configuration file used by **Kustomize**, a Kubernetes-native tool for managing configurations. Instead of modifying YAML files directly, Kustomize allows you to customize **deployments, services, and other resources** declaratively.

---

## 🤔 When to Use `kustomization.yaml`?
✅ **Customizing Kubernetes resources** without modifying original YAML files.
✅ **Managing multiple environments** (dev, staging, production) efficiently.
✅ **Overriding specific configurations** using patches and overlays.
✅ **Applying bulk transformations** (e.g., labels, annotations, namespace changes).
✅ **Using in CI/CD pipelines** for GitOps-style deployments.

---

## 🚫 When NOT to Use `kustomization.yaml`?
❌ If you need **templating, loops, or complex conditions** → use **Helm** instead.
❌ If you are **deploying third-party applications** → Helm charts are more suitable.
❌ If your application has **complex dependencies** → Helm’s package manager is better.

---

## 🔥 Best Practices for `kustomization.yaml`
- **Keep base YAML files unmodified** – use overlays for customization.
- **Use descriptive naming conventions** (e.g., `kustomization-dev.yaml`, `kustomization-prod.yaml`).
- **Organize configurations into folders** (`base/` and `overlays/`).
- **Use labels and annotations** for better resource tracking.
- **Keep secrets in a separate secure location** instead of embedding them.
- **Test configurations locally** before applying them to a cluster.

---

## 🚀 Should a Kubernetes Cluster Be Created Before Using `kustomization.yaml`?
✅ **Yes, a Kubernetes cluster must exist before applying Kustomize configurations.**
Kustomize does not create clusters; it only manages **Kubernetes objects** inside an existing cluster.

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Guide to Using `kustomization.yaml`

### **1️⃣ Create a Kubernetes Cluster** (if not already created)
If you don’t have a cluster, create one using Kind:
```sh
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
EOF
```
Verify the cluster is running:
```sh
kubectl get nodes
```

---

### **2️⃣ Set Up Directory Structure**
```sh
mkdir -p k8s/base k8s/overlays/dev k8s/overlays/prod
cd k8s
```

---

### **3️⃣ Create Base Kubernetes Manifests**

#### `k8s/base/nginx-deployment.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### `k8s/base/nginx-service.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

#### `k8s/base/kustomization.yaml`
```yaml
resources:
  - nginx-deployment.yaml
  - nginx-service.yaml
```

---

### **4️⃣ Create Overlays for Dev & Prod**

#### `k8s/overlays/dev/kustomization.yaml`
```yaml
bases:
  - ../../base

patches:
  - path: deployment-patch.yaml
```

#### `k8s/overlays/dev/deployment-patch.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
```

#### `k8s/overlays/prod/kustomization.yaml`
```yaml
bases:
  - ../../base

patches:
  - path: deployment-patch.yaml
```

#### `k8s/overlays/prod/deployment-patch.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 5
```

---

### **5️⃣ Deploy Using Kustomize**
#### **Apply Base Configuration**
```sh
kubectl apply -k k8s/base/
```

#### **Apply Dev Environment**
```sh
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/dev/
```

#### **Apply Prod Environment**
```sh
kubectl apply -k k8s/overlays/prod/
```

Verify deployment:
```sh
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
```

---

## ✅ Summary
- **`kustomization.yaml`** allows managing Kubernetes configurations without modifying base YAML files.
- **Kustomize overlays** help customize deployments for different environments.
- **A Kubernetes cluster must be created first** before applying `kustomization.yaml`.
- **Follow best practices** such as keeping secrets separate, using structured directories, and testing locally.
