# 🌐 Container Network Interface (CNI) - CKA Guide

The **Container Network Interface (CNI)** is a standard interface that provides network connectivity to Linux containers. It plays a crucial role in Kubernetes and other container orchestration systems by managing how containers connect to the network.

---

## ❓ Why is CNI Used?
CNI provides a **standard way** for container runtimes (like containerd, CRI-O, or Docker) to connect containers to a network. It solves the problem of dynamically assigning networking resources to containers in a consistent, portable way.

### 🔧 Problems Solved by CNI
- Dynamic network assignment to containers
- Decouples network logic from container runtime
- Plug-and-play network plugins (e.g., Calico, Flannel, Weave)
- Standard interface across all container platforms

---

## 📦 What is CNI?
- CNI is a set of **specifications and libraries** for writing plugins to configure network interfaces in Linux containers.
- A CNI plugin is a binary that:
  - Receives container info and configuration via stdin
  - Sets up or tears down network for the container
  - Returns result in JSON format

---

## ⚙️ How CNI Works

### 🧱 Basic Workflow
1. **Container Runtime** (e.g., containerd) creates a new **network namespace** for the container
2. Identifies which **network** (CNI config) the container should attach to
3. Calls the CNI plugin’s `ADD` command with container info in JSON
4. Plugin sets up veth pair, bridge, IP allocation, routes, etc.
5. Plugin responds with success and network configuration in JSON
6. On container deletion, runtime calls the CNI plugin’s `DEL` command to clean up networking

## 🛠️ CNI Plugin Lifecycle

### 🟢 ADD Command
```bash
# Pseudo
cni-plugin ADD {namespace, ifname, args, cniVersion, config} --> result.json
```
- Sets up networking
- Creates veth pair
- Attaches one to container, other to host bridge
- Allocates IP
- Adds routes

### 🔴 DEL Command
```bash
# Pseudo
cni-plugin DEL {namespace, ifname, args, cniVersion, config}
```
- Removes veth pair
- Releases IP
- Cleans up routing entries

---

## 🧾 CNI Configuration Format (JSON)
Each CNI plugin uses a config file usually found in `/etc/cni/net.d/`:

### 📄 Example:
```json
{
  "cniVersion": "0.3.1",
  "name": "my-network",
  "type": "bridge",
  "bridge": "cni0",
  "isGateway": true,
  "ipMasq": true,
  "ipam": {
    "type": "host-local",
    "subnet": "10.22.0.0/16",
    "routes": [
      { "dst": "0.0.0.0/0" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🔌 Popular CNI Plugins
| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| bridge | Default plugin; uses Linux bridge and veth |
| host-local | Static IPAM plugin for IP address management |
| flannel | Overlay network plugin |
| calico | L3-based networking with security policies |
| weave | Simplified overlay network |
| loopback | Configures loopback interface (required) |

---

## 📚 How Kubernetes Uses CNI
- Kubelet calls the **CRI (Container Runtime Interface)**, which in turn uses CNI to configure pod networking
- Kubernetes expects CNI binaries and config files to be present on every node:
  - Binaries: `/opt/cni/bin/`
  - Config: `/etc/cni/net.d/`

```
[Container Runtime]

     | creates network ns
     v
[CNI Plugin ADD (bridge, flannel, etc.)]
     |
     | sets up veth, IP, route
     v
[Container ↔ Bridge ↔ Host ↔ Internet]
```

## 🔍 Verification Tools
```bash
# Check network namespace
ip netns list

# Inspect container networking
ip link
ip addr
ip route

# View CNI config
cat /etc/cni/net.d/*.conf

# CNI logs and errors (via container runtime or kubelet logs)
```

## ✅ Summary Table
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Container runtime creates network namespace |
| 2 | Selects appropriate CNI config and plugin |
| 3 | Calls plugin with ADD command |
| 4 | Plugin sets up networking (bridge, veth, IP) |
| 5 | Plugin returns config to runtime |
| 6 | On container deletion, runtime calls plugin with DEL |

CNI is an essential concept for the CKA exam. Understanding its architecture, workflow, and plugin ecosystem is vital for mastering Kubernetes networking.
