# 🧠 DNS Basics and Domain Resolution

This section explains why DNS is crucial, how Linux systems resolve domain names to IP addresses, and how you can troubleshoot and inspect name resolution using commands like `nslookup` and `dig`. Perfect for understanding `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/resolv.conf`, and domain resolution process.

---

## 📌 Why Use DNS?
- IP addresses are hard to remember.
- DNS allows us to use human-friendly names like `www.google.com` instead of `142.250.190.4`.
- Whenever we refer to services like `db`, we want it to resolve to an actual IP address using DNS.

## 🧱 Static DNS Using `/etc/hosts`

### 🔍 What is `/etc/hosts`?
- A local file that maps hostnames to IP addresses.

### 📄 Example
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
**Output:**
```
127.0.0.1   localhost
192.168.1.10   db
```

So when you `ping db`, the system checks `/etc/hosts`, finds `192.168.1.10`, and sends packets there.

> ✅ Great for a small number of systems.
> ❌ Not scalable — must be updated manually on every system.

## 📁 `/etc/resolv.conf`

### 🔍 What is it?
- Tells the system which **DNS name servers** to query if the hostname is not found in `/etc/hosts`.

### 📄 Example
```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```
**Output:**
```
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 1.1.1.1
```

This means if the system cannot resolve a name using `/etc/hosts`, it queries Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1).

## 🧽 DNS Lookup Order
1. Check `/etc/hosts`
2. If not found, check `/etc/resolv.conf` to contact external name servers

## 🌍 Domain Resolution: Step-by-Step (Example: `www.google.com`)

1. **Application Layer:** You type `www.google.com` into your browser.
2. **Local Check:** System checks `/etc/hosts` for `www.google.com`
3. **DNS Query:** If not found, system sends a query to DNS server in `/etc/resolv.conf`
4. **Recursive Lookup Begins:**
   - **Root Server** → Tells location of `.com` TLD server
   - **.com TLD Server** → Tells location of `google.com` name server
   - **google.com Name Server** → Returns IP of `www.google.com`
5. **System Connects to IP Address** → e.g., `142.250.190.4`

## 🧪 DNS Troubleshooting Tools

### 🔎 `nslookup`
```bash
nslookup www.google.com
```
- Returns IP address of the domain
- Queries DNS server listed in `/etc/resolv.conf`

### 🔬 `dig` (Domain Information Groper)
```bash
dig www.google.com
```
- Detailed DNS information
- Shows query time, DNS servers used, and record types (A, MX, etc.)

### ↻ Example Output:
```bash
dig www.google.com

; <<>> DiG 9.18.1 <<>> www.google.com
;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.google.com.    239 IN A 142.250.190.4
```

## ✅ Summary
| File/Command        | Purpose |
|---------------------|---------|
| `/etc/hosts`        | Local name resolution file |
| `/etc/resolv.conf`  | DNS server addresses |
| `nslookup`          | Basic DNS query tool |
| `dig`               | Advanced DNS inspection tool |

---

## 🧑‍💻 Final Notes
- Use `/etc/hosts` for local testing and overrides
- Use `/etc/resolv.conf` to configure name servers
- Use `nslookup` and `dig` to debug name resolution problems
