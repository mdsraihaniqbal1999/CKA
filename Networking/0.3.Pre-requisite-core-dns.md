# 🧠 CoreDNS: A Detailed Setup Guide

CoreDNS is a fast, flexible, and modern DNS server. It is widely used in container environments and is the default DNS server in Kubernetes. This guide covers everything from downloading CoreDNS to configuring it using its Corefile and `/etc/hosts`.

---

## 📌 Why CoreDNS?
- Centralized DNS server for multiple hosts
- Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
- Simple and declarative configuration
- Native integration with Kubernetes

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 🧰 Pre-requisites
- A Linux server with internet access
- Root/sudo privileges

### 🔽 Step 1: Download CoreDNS Binary
You can either get it via Docker or download the binary directly.
We’ll go the traditional binary route.

```bash
# Download latest release (example: v1.11.1)
curl -O https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/download/v1.11.1/coredns_1.11.1_linux_amd64.tgz

# Extract it
tar -xvzf coredns_1.11.1_linux_amd64.tgz
cd coredns
```

This gives you the `coredns` executable.

---

### 🚀 Step 2: Create a Corefile
CoreDNS reads its configuration from a file named `Corefile`.

Here’s a minimal configuration to use `/etc/hosts` for name resolution:

```hcl
. {
  hosts /etc/hosts {
    fallthrough
  }
  forward . 8.8.8.8
  log
}
```

#### 🔍 What Each Block Does:
- `.`: Listen for all zones
- `hosts /etc/hosts`: Read hostnames from the system's `/etc/hosts` file
- `fallthrough`: Pass unresolved queries to the next plugin (`forward`)
- `forward . 8.8.8.8`: Forward unresolved DNS queries to Google's DNS
- `log`: Log DNS queries to stdout

---

### 🗂️ Step 3: Populate `/etc/hosts`
Add static hostname-to-IP mappings:
```bash
echo "192.168.1.10 web" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Now `web` will resolve to `192.168.1.10` if queried through CoreDNS.

---

### 🏃 Step 4: Run CoreDNS
```bash
./coredns
```
- By default, CoreDNS listens on port **53** (DNS port)
- You should see logs like:
```
.:53
2025-04-11T12:34:56Z [INFO] CoreDNS-1.11.1 starting
```

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test the DNS Server
### On any client machine:
Edit its `/etc/resolv.conf`:
```bash
nameserver <IP_of_CoreDNS_Server>
```
Then run:
```bash
nslookup web
# OR
dig web
```
You should see a response with IP `192.168.1.10`

---

## 🔁 Flow Diagram
```
[Client] --DNS--> [CoreDNS] --> /etc/hosts
                             --> (if not found) --> 8.8.8.8
```

---

## 📚 Advanced Use Cases
- Serve DNS records from zone files
- Integrate with Kubernetes using the `kubernetes` plugin
- Load balancing and caching

### Plugins Reference:
- [CoreDNS Plugins](https://coredns.io/plugins/)
- [Kubernetes Plugin](https://coredns.io/plugins/kubernetes/)

---

## 🧼 Clean Shutdown
```bash
# Use Ctrl+C or
pkill coredns
```

---

## ✅ Summary
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Lightweight | Single binary, fast startup |
| Flexible | Plugin-based configuration |
| Centralized | Manage DNS in one place |
| Extensible | Supports zones, forwarders, hosts, and more |

---

CoreDNS is an ideal DNS solution for modern infrastructures and container environments. Once configured properly, it makes host resolution efficient and centralized.
