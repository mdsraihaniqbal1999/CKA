# Helm Chart Hooks: A Guide for CKA Exam 🚀

## 📌 Understanding Helm Chart Hooks
Helm Chart Hooks allow you to execute scripts at different points in the Helm release lifecycle. These hooks are useful for tasks like database migrations, config setup, and cleanup actions.

### 🔹 Why Use Helm Hooks?
- **Pre-install or post-delete tasks**: Run jobs before/after deployment.
- **Database migrations**: Initialize data before application starts.
- **Custom initialization logic**: Configure services dynamically.
- **Cleanup tasks**: Remove resources after uninstalling a release.

## 🔹 General Syntax of a Hook
A hook is a Kubernetes resource with an annotation specifying the event it should trigger on.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: my-hook-job
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "-5"
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: hook-container
          image: busybox
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Pre-install task running"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```
✅ The annotations tell Helm this Job should run before installation.

## 📌 Types of Helm Hooks

| Hook Type       | Description | Example Use Case |
|----------------|------------|------------------|
| `pre-install`  | Runs before resources are created | Database setup |
| `post-install` | Runs after resources are created | Configuration updates |
| `pre-upgrade`  | Runs before an upgrade starts | Backup before upgrading |
| `post-upgrade` | Runs after an upgrade completes | Verify upgrade success |
| `pre-delete`   | Runs before deletion starts | Graceful shutdown tasks |
| `post-delete`  | Runs after deletion completes | Cleanup orphaned resources |
| `pre-rollback` | Runs before rollback starts | Backup before rollback |
| `post-rollback` | Runs after rollback completes | Notify about rollback |

---

## 🔹 Annotations Used in Hooks
Annotations are used to define hook behavior.

| Annotation | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `helm.sh/hook` | Specifies hook type | `"helm.sh/hook": post-install` |
| `helm.sh/hook-weight` | Controls execution order (-5 runs before 0) | `"helm.sh/hook-weight": "-5"` |
| `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy` | Determines when hook resources are deleted | `"helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation` |

### 🔍 Example: Hook with Multiple Annotations
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: my-upgrade-hook
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-upgrade
    "helm.sh/hook-weight": "0"
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-succeeded
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: upgrade-task
          image: busybox
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Performing upgrade tasks"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```
✅ This Job runs before an upgrade, deletes itself after success, and runs at weight `0`.

---

## 🛠 Where to Place Hook Scripts?
Hook templates should be placed inside the `templates/` directory of the Helm chart.

### 📦 Helm Chart Structure with Hooks
```sh
helm-chart/
├── templates/
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── pre-install-job.yaml
│   │   ├── post-delete-job.yaml
├── values.yaml
├── Chart.yaml
```
✅ The `hooks/` directory is optional but helps organize hooks.

---

## 🚀 Practical Example: Using Helm Hooks in a Kind Cluster
### 🏗 Cluster Setup (1 Control Plane, 2 Workers)
Ensure you have a running Kind cluster:
```sh
kind create cluster --name helm-demo --config=kind-config.yaml
```
Example `kind-config.yaml`:
```yaml
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
  - role: control-plane
  - role: worker
  - role: worker
```

### 🔹 Define a Pre-Install Hook (`templates/hooks/pre-install-job.yaml`)
```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pre-install-job
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook": pre-install
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: setup-task
          image: busybox
          command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Setting up resources"]
      restartPolicy: Never
```
✅ This hook ensures setup tasks are completed before installing the chart.

### 🔹 Install the Helm Chart
```sh
helm install myapp ./helm-chart --values values.yaml
```
✅ The `pre-install` hook executes before the main application resources are created.

## 🤔 Tricky Questions on Helm Hooks

### 1️⃣ What happens if a `pre-install` hook fails?
- **A)** The Helm installation proceeds.
- **B)** The installation fails.
- **C)** Helm retries the hook.

✅ **Answer:** B) The installation fails.

---

### 2️⃣ What is the default hook execution order if `helm.sh/hook-weight` is not set?
- **A)** Hooks execute randomly.
- **B)** Hooks execute in alphabetical order.
- **C)** Hooks execute in no specific order.

✅ **Answer:** C) Hooks execute in no specific order.

---

### 3️⃣ Modify the following hook to delete only on success:
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": before-hook-creation
```
✅ **Solution:**
```yaml
metadata:
  annotations:
    "helm.sh/hook-delete-policy": hook-succeeded
```

---

### 4️⃣ What happens if a `pre-upgrade` hook fails?
- **A)** The upgrade fails and the release remains unchanged.
- **B)** The upgrade proceeds anyway.
- **C)** Helm rolls back automatically.

✅ **Answer:** A) The upgrade fails and the release remains unchanged.

---

### 5️⃣ How do you ensure a `post-delete` hook always runs?
- **A)** Use `helm.sh/hook: post-delete` without delete policies.
- **B)** Set `helm.sh/hook-delete-policy: before-hook-creation`.
- **C)** There is no way to guarantee it runs.

✅ **Answer:** A) Use `helm.sh/hook: post-delete` without delete policies.
