# 📌 Helm Components Explained

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment and management. Below is a detailed explanation of its core components, challenges it solves, and best practices.

## 📦 Helm Components (Detailed Explanation)

### 1️⃣ **Helm Client (helm)**
- The command-line tool that users interact with to manage Helm charts and releases.
- Allows you to install, upgrade, rollback, and delete releases.
- **Challenge Solved**: Provides a standardized way to manage Kubernetes applications.
- **When to Use**: When you need to automate and streamline application deployment.
- **When Not to Use**: If you prefer manual `kubectl` configurations.

### 2️⃣ **Helm Library**
- A collection of Go packages that provide the core logic for Helm.
- Used by the Helm client and other tools integrating with Helm.
- **Challenge Solved**: Enables custom integrations and automation with Helm functionalities.
- **When to Use**: When building applications that interact with Helm programmatically.
- **When Not to Use**: If only using Helm via CLI.

### 3️⃣ **Chart**
- A Helm chart is a package that contains all necessary Kubernetes resources to deploy an application.
- Includes templates, configurations, and metadata.
- **Challenge Solved**: Standardizes application deployment by packaging everything needed into a single unit.
- **When to Use**: When you need to deploy reusable applications across environments.
- **When Not to Use**: If deploying a simple application with minimal Kubernetes configurations.

### 4️⃣ **Values.yaml**
- A configuration file where users define custom values to override default settings in a Helm chart.
- **Challenge Solved**: Allows environment-specific configurations without modifying the chart itself.
- **When to Use**: When you need to customize application parameters dynamically (e.g., dev, staging, production).
- **When Not to Use**: If the application does not require dynamic configurations.

### 5️⃣ **Templates**
- A set of Kubernetes YAML manifest files that use Go templating to generate resources dynamically.
- **Challenge Solved**: Enables reusable and configurable deployments instead of hardcoded YAML files.
- **When to Use**: When defining Kubernetes resources in a scalable and configurable manner.
- **When Not to Use**: If your deployment is static and does not need templating.

### 6️⃣ **Release**
- A Helm release is an installed version of a Helm chart in a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Challenge Solved**: Enables versioned deployments and rollback capabilities.
- **When to Use**: When deploying applications with Helm to track and manage versions.
- **When Not to Use**: If managing applications manually with `kubectl apply`.

### 7️⃣ **Revision**
- A version history of a Helm release. Every Helm update creates a new revision.
- **Challenge Solved**: Provides rollback functionality in case of deployment failure.
- **When to Use**: When you need version control and rollback options for deployments.
- **When Not to Use**: If versioning is unnecessary or a simple deployment strategy suffices.

### 8️⃣ **Repository**
- A Helm repository is a location where packaged charts can be stored and shared.
- Repositories can be public or private.
- **Challenge Solved**: Enables version-controlled sharing and distribution of Helm charts.
- **When to Use**: When you need to distribute Helm charts across teams or environments.
- **When Not to Use**: If deploying only local charts.

### 9️⃣ **Plugins**
- Helm supports plugins, which extend its functionality with additional commands.
- **Challenge Solved**: Provides extensibility for custom Helm features.
- **When to Use**: When Helm’s core functionality needs to be expanded.
- **When Not to Use**: If built-in Helm commands are sufficient.

### 🔟 **Tiller (Deprecated)**
- Tiller was the server-side component of Helm 2, removed in Helm 3.
- **Challenge Solved**: Removing Tiller improved security and simplified Helm architecture.
- **When to Use**: No longer needed since Helm 3.
- **When Not to Use**: Always, as it has been deprecated.

# 🚀 Creating a Helm Chart from Scratch in VS Code

## 🏗️ 1. Setting Up the Kind Cluster

We will create a Kind cluster with **one control plane node and two worker nodes**.

### Install Kind and Kubectl

Ensure that Kind and kubectl are installed.

```sh
# Install Kind
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x kind
mv kind /usr/local/bin/

# Install kubectl
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Create a Kind Cluster

```sh
cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --name helm-cluster --config -
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
- role: worker
- role: worker
EOF
```

Verify the cluster:

```sh
kubectl get nodes
```

## 📂 2. Creating a Helm Chart in VS Code

Open VS Code and create a directory for your chart:

```sh
mkdir my-helm-chart && cd my-helm-chart
helm create myapp
```

### Helm Chart Directory Structure

```plaintext
myapp/
├── charts/            # Dependencies (if any)
├── templates/         # YAML templates for Kubernetes resources
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   └── NOTES.txt
├── values.yaml        # Configuration values
├── Chart.yaml         # Metadata about the chart
└── README.md          # Documentation
```

## 🎯 3. Understanding Helm Releases and Revisions

| Concept     | What is it? |
|------------|------------|
| **Release**  | A specific instance of a Helm chart deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. |
| **Revision** | A version of a Helm release stored in history. Every update creates a new revision. |

### 📌 Checking Helm Release History

```sh
helm list
helm history myapp
```

### 🚀 Deploying the Helm Chart as a Release

```sh
helm install myapp ./myapp
```

### 🔄 Updating the Release (Creating a New Revision)

```sh
helm upgrade myapp ./myapp
```

### 🔙 Rolling Back to a Previous Revision

```sh
helm rollback myapp <revision_number>
```
