## ðŸ“Œ Major Differences Between Helm v2 and Helm v3

| Feature | Helm v2 | Helm v3 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Tiller** | Requires Tiller (server-side component) | Removed Tiller (client-only architecture) |
| **Security** | RBAC issues with Tiller | Improved security (no Tiller) |
| **CRD Management** | Installed via hooks, lacked lifecycle management | Proper CRD lifecycle management with `crds/` directory |
| **Release Namespaces** | Releases were stored in `kube-system` | Releases stored in the namespace where deployed |
| **Helm Hooks** | Limited support | Improved hook management |
| **Chart Values** | Required `helm delete --purge` to fully remove releases | Automatic clean-up of previous values |
| **Chart Repositories** | Managed via `helm serve` | Uses OCI-based repositories for better security and flexibility |
| **3-Way Strategic Merge Patch** | Not supported | Supported |

## ðŸ“Œ What is 3-Way Strategic Merge Patch? ðŸ”„
One of the key improvements in Helm v3 is the **3-Way Strategic Merge Patch**, which enhances the upgrade process.

### âœ… How it Works:
1. **Last Applied Configuration**: Stores the last applied manifest of a release.
2. **Live State in Kubernetes**: Checks the current state of the resource in the cluster.
3. **New Configuration**: Compares the new Helm chart manifest with the stored configuration and live state.

### ðŸš€ Benefits:
- **Avoids Overwriting Manual Changes**: Preserves manually applied changes in the cluster.
- **Better Merge Strategy**: Ensures safer upgrades and rollbacks.
- **Prevents Unintended Deletions**: Avoids accidental removal of Kubernetes objects.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Helm v3 is a major improvement over Helm v2, particularly with security enhancements, better CRD management, and the introduction of **3-Way Strategic Merge Patch**, making deployments more reliable and flexible.

Helm v3 is the recommended version for all Kubernetes deployments today. ðŸš€
