## 📌 Key Differences Between Helm v2 and Helm v3

| Feature | Helm v2 🏛️ | Helm v3 🚀 |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **Tiller** | Required (server-side component) | Removed (client-only architecture) |
| **Security** | RBAC configurations needed for Tiller | More secure, no Tiller needed |
| **CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions)** | Managed manually | Managed via `crds/` directory in charts |
| **Release Namespaces** | Releases stored in Tiller's namespace | Releases stored in the namespace where installed |
| **Chart Format** | Uses `requirements.yaml` for dependencies | Uses `Chart.yaml` with `dependencies` field |
| **Upgrades & Rollbacks** | Uses `helm upgrade --force` | Uses 3-way strategic merge patch for better rollbacks |
| **Hooks** | Limited hook functionality | Enhanced hook support with better lifecycle management |
| **Library Charts** | Not supported | Supports library charts for reusable components |
| **Kubernetes API Support** | Uses Tiller’s API | Directly interacts with Kubernetes API |
| **CLI Improvements** | Commands require Tiller interactions | Simplified CLI without Tiller dependency |
