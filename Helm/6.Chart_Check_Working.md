# ✅ Verifying Helm Chart Deployment

This guide ensures that your Helm chart is correctly deployed and functioning in a Kubernetes cluster.

---

## 🎯 1. Why Verify a Helm Chart?

| Aspect                | Importance |
|----------------------|------------|
| **Ensures Correct Deployment** | Confirms that all resources are created as expected. |
| **Identifies Misconfigurations** | Helps detect any YAML or value errors. |
| **Validates Application Behavior** | Ensures that the service is up and running. |

---

## 📌 2. Steps to Verify a Helm Chart

### Step 1: List Installed Releases
```sh
helm list
```
- Ensures that the release is deployed successfully.

### Step 2: Check Kubernetes Resources
```sh
kubectl get all -l release=my-release
```
- Lists all resources created by the Helm chart.

### Step 3: Inspect the Service
```sh
kubectl get svc -l release=my-release
```
- Ensure the service is correctly exposed.

### Step 4: View Pod Logs
```sh
kubectl logs -l release=my-release
```
- Helps troubleshoot application errors.

### Step 5: Verify Helm Templates
```sh
helm template my-release ./my-chart
```
- Renders the templates locally to check for errors.

### Step 6: Run Helm Lint
```sh
helm lint ./my-chart
```
- Checks for syntax and best practices in Helm charts.

## 🔄 3. Testing the Helm Chart

### Running a Dry Run
```sh
helm install my-release ./my-chart --dry-run --debug
```
- Checks for errors without deploying resources.

### Running a Test Suite
```sh
helm test my-release
```
- Runs Helm test hooks if configured.

## 🚀 4. Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Pods stuck in `Pending`** | Check node resources with `kubectl describe pod`. |
| **Service not reachable** | Verify service type and ports with `kubectl get svc`. |
| **Template errors** | Run `helm lint` to validate YAML structure. |

---

## 🏁 5. Best Practices

| Practice | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| **Use Helm Linting** | Catches syntax errors early. |
| **Leverage `helm test`** | Automates post-deployment checks. |
| **Monitor Application Logs** | Helps detect runtime issues. |

By following this guide, you ensure that your Helm chart is correctly deployed and functioning as expected in a Kubernetes environment. 🚀

### 📌 Reference: Cluster Setup
This verification process applies to the Kind cluster created in the previous section, which consists of **1 control plane node** and **2 worker nodes**.
